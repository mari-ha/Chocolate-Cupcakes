Preheat oven to 350˚F. Line a 12-cup cupcake pan with cupcake liners. Line another cupcake pan with three cupcake liners for a total of 15. Set aside. Combine dry ingredients in a medium-size bowl and whisk to combine. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add milk, oil, egg, vanilla and coffee. Stir with a whisk until all ingredients are combined then continue to whisk until batter is smooth. Scrape the sides of the bowl and mix for another 10-15 seconds. The batter will be thinner than most cake batters, don’t worry, it’s just the way it should be. Fill cupcake liners just half full. (I'm always tempted to fill them higher and when I do, they overflow.) Place in the oven and reduce the temperature to 325˚F. Bake 18-24 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from the oven and allow the cupcakes to cool completely. Decorate as desired.
